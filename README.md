# shp2nc

A MATLAB function which can convert shp files from GADM (https://gadm.org/) to netCDF.

Prerequisites:
1. Mapping toolbox
2. SNC toolbox

ps: This script was written long time ago, thus, it only works with GADM v2.8 shpfiles. If you need to use the newest GADM's shp files, minor changes to the codes might be needed on how the script read the shp file's information (maybe I will update this code in the future).
